# ``KosherSwift``

A Swift version of KosherJava
Heavily referenced KosherDart, which I also previously contributed to.

Also check out [KosherCocoa](https://github.com/MosheBerman/KosherCocoa) (an Objective C port) and the other [KosherSwift](https://github.com/Elyahu41/KosherSwift) that I didn't know existed when I created this.

## Overview

There is still a small handfull of things I would like to add, but this library is definitely usable. I am in the process of implementing KosherSwift into my app, [YidKit](http://yidkit.com).

If you've got any enhancements to offer, bugs to fix, or general contributions, feel free to contact me with a pull request or an email.
